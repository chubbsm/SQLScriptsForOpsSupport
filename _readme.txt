Hi! You've just downloaded a bunch of free stuff that I hope you find useful.
It's our scripts, setup checklists, and resources for Microsoft SQL Server.

The scripts include:

sp_Blitz - "Somebody just handed me a SQL Server. Is it in good shape?" 

sp_BlitzFirst - "Why is my SQL Server slow right now?"

sp_BlitzCache - "What are the most resource-intensive queries on this server?"

sp_BlitzIndex - "How could I tune indexes to make this database faster?"

sp_BlitzQueryStore - "How has this query performed over time?" 

Power BI Dashboard for DBAs - "How has my server performed over time?"

sp_AllNightLog - "How can I automate cloud log shipping even when new databases are added?"

Documentation for all of them, including parameters and results explanations:
